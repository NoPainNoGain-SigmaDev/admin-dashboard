# 🚀 Admin Dashboard

## About  
This is my solution to the **Admin Dashboard** project, part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum. It was built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on CSS Grid layout and component structure.

## Preview  
The goal was to recreate this design using grid — and I think I nailed it 💪
